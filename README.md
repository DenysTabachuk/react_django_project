# Coursework for the 3rd Year of KPI, FICT, 121 Software Engineering

This project is a **modern web application** that serves as a **car rental and dealership platform**, built using the **Python Django framework** for the backend and **React.js** for the frontend. It combines a robust server-side architecture with a dynamic, user-friendly client interface to provide seamless user experiences.

This platform has three types of users, each with different access levels and permissions:

### 1. **Unauthorized User**
An unauthorized user can:
- View company information, rental terms, and car details.
- Access the registration and login pages.
- Use basic car search functionality with filters.

### 2. **Authorized User**
An authorized user can:
- Rent a car.
- View and edit their personal profile.
- View current and past rentals.

### 3. **Administrator**
An administrator has full control over the platform and can:
- Manage car rentals (view and update rental status).
- Manage the car fleet (add, edit, and delete cars).


I know there's a lot of room for improvement and rework, but I made it to the deadline! ðŸ˜Š
