# Coursework for the 3rd Year of KPI, FICT, 121 Software Engineering

This project is a **modern web application** that serves as a **car rental and dealership platform**, built using the **Python Django framework** for the backend and **React.js** for the frontend. It combines a robust server-side architecture with a dynamic, user-friendly client interface to provide seamless user experiences.

I know there's a lot of room for improvement and rework, but I made it to the deadline! ðŸ˜Š
